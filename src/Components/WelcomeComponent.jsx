                Hello and welcome to Dylan's skill assessment project for the Software Development Position I applied to at the BYU Library. This project will 
                be working with the Github REST API. This is a GUI React project primarily written in JavaScript. The requirements for this project are 
                to do the following:
            </div>
            <div className ="container">
            <br/>
                Allow a user to rate Books/Movies<br/>
            <br/>
                Thank you again for your time and consideration,<br/>
                -Dylan John Pratt
            </div>
        </body>
